      "Sayyad Fayaz Ahmad Shah is a chemistry researcher with an M.Phil degree and specialized expertise in organic synthesis, nanomaterials, polymer composites, and computational chemistry. His work spans the green synthesis of functional nanomaterials (including carbon dots and Ag@Zn nanocomposites), design and evaluation of indole-based chalcones and Schiff bases, and computational modelling and docking using MOE, AutoDock Vina, and Discovery Studio.",
      "He is particularly interested in the intersection of synthesis of bioactive organic compounds, computational catalysis, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and MOF/polymer composite materials, aiming to develop advanced materials for catalytic, sensing, and biomedical applications.",
      "With combined experience in academic research and pharmaceutical quality control, he integrates experimental synthesis, computational chemistry, and analytical techniques to solve complex chemical problems. He is actively seeking fully funded PhD opportunities and international research collaborations in medicinal chemistry, organic chemistry, materials chemistry, catalysis, and computational modelling."
